# .vim
My personal Vim configuration and plugin files.

# To install:
- run `git clone https://github.com/twolfe21/.vim.git` from your home (`~`) directory.
- Create a `swapfiles` directory under the newly cloned `.vim` directory.
- open Vim.
- the plugin manager and plugins themselves should auto-install.
